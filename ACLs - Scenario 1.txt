Part 1: 
Step 1: 
R1(config)# access-list 100 permit tcp 172.22.34.64 0.0.0.31 host 172.22.34.62 eq ftp

Step 2: 
R1(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
R1(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in

Step 3:
a. Ping from PC1 to Server. If the pings are unsuccessful, verify the IP addresses before continuing.
b. FTP from PC1 to Server. The username and password are both cisco.

PC1> ftp 172.22.34.62
ftp> quit
d. Ping from PC1 to PC2. The destination host should be unreachable, because the traffic was not explicitly permitted. 

Part 2: 
Step 1: 

R1(config)# ip access-list extended HTTP_ONLY
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 172.22.34.96 0.0.0.15 host 172.22.34.62 eq www
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit icmp 172.22.34.96 0.0.0.15 host 172.22.34.62

Step 2: 
R1(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
R1(config-if)# ip access-group HTTP_ONLY in

Step
3: Verify the ACL implementation.
a. Ping from PC2 to Server. The ping should be successful, if the ping is unsuccessful, verify the IP addresses before continuing.
b. FTP from PC2 to Server. The connection should fail.
c. Open the web browser on PC2 and enter the IP address of Server as the URL. The connection should be successful.
